# trans-MRI: Transfer Learning for MRI
A lighweight library built on PyTorch enabling quick transfer learning across MRI datasets.

Supports knowledge transfer from general-domain autoencoder pre-training to a target task by discriminative fine-tuning (e.g. to classify diseases).

### Installation:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ben0it8/trans-MRI.git
```
