# trans-MRI: Transfer Learning for MRI
A lighweight library built on PyTorch enabling quick transfer learning across MRI datasets.

Supports: 
* knowledge transfer from general-domain autoencoder pretraining to a target task by discriminative fine-tuning (e.g. to classify diseases)
* self-supervised or semi-supervised pretraining modes
* sparse latent representation
* different latent space visualizations

In the future, generative pretraining will be added.


### Installation:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ben0it8/trans-MRI.git
```
